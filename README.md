## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- One challenge I had while building this application was that I was having trouble running the application on the simulator. It turns out having a `:` in the application name created issues with running the application.

- I also had some difficulty with finding some areas of the XCode Editor. I searched up reference pictures to hopefully to find what was needed.
