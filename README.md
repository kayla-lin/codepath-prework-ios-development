## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

- Instagram: I like the "like" animation, and the able to chat with friends.
- TikTok: I like the ability to have a infinite scrolling with videos and being able to share the video easily.
- EggMon: I like the art in the application and all the animations / GIFs.

I would like to create a messaging application. The application will be geared towards couples and will give a prompt daily that two users will need to respond to in order to see each others' responds.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- One challenge I had while building this application was that I was having trouble running the application on the simulator. It turns out having a `:` in the application name created issues with running the application.

- I also had some difficulty with finding some areas of the XCode Editor. I searched up reference pictures to hopefully to find what was needed.
